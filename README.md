# Amazon Review Analysis

## Synopsis

There is a large dataset of amazon reviews for each project. In this folder, I demonstrate how Spark can be utilized to create several analysis of the data, from creating a recommendar system to predicting the sentiment of a given review.   

## Data Source

The following data was taken from http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/.   The data is too large to be analyzed in memory, so I used Spark, which can provide machine learning services for large datasets.
